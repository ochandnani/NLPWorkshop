# Natural Language Processing
* Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is the sub-field of AI that is focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages. Let’s check out how NLP works and learn how to write programs that can extract information out of raw text using Python!

# Why Natural Language Processing
* Computers can’t yet truly understand English in the way that humans do — but they can already do a lot! In certain limited    areas, what you can do with NLP already seems like magic. You might be able to save a lot of time by applying NLP techniques  to your own projects.
